Functions in the future
* add support of languade detection
* add stop-words lists for the most popular languages to improve efficiency

My Idea in future:
 if there is ability to detect source language (module detects it) the library process text with general algorithm, but before makes preprocessing by removing stop-words from content - in other case - just uses this general algorithm
